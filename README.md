# Voidwalker

A work-in-progress 2D Zelda-inspired action/adventure game in the style of early NES and SNES Adventure/RPG games.

Built in Ruby with the Gosu gem, the current build of Voidwalker showcases collision-detection between the player and interactable objects (coins) and dungeon walls.

Further updates will incorporate my [Ruby Maze Generator](https://github.com/gvbilello/ruby-maze-generator) to create randomly-generated maze dungeons for the player to explore.  Dungeons will eventually incorporate enemies, items, treasure, and equipment upgrades.
